# Investigating-Android-malware-dataset (CIC-InvesAndMal2019)
We provide the second part of the CIC-AndMal2017 dataset publicly available namely CIC-InvesAndMal2019 which includes permissions and intents as static features and API calls and all generated log files as dynamic features in three steps (During installation, before restarting and after restarting the phone). In this part, we improve our malware category and family classification performance around 30% by combining the previous dynamic features (80 network-flows by using [**CICFlowMeter-V3**](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter)) with 2-gram sequential relations of API calls. In addition, we examine these features in the presented two-layer malware analysis framework. Besides these, we provide other captured features such as battery states, log states, packages, process logs, etc.

In this second part of the dataset, we followed the same installation and capturing process as previous:

We installed 5,000 of the collected samples (426 malware and 5,065 benign) on real devices. Our malware samples in this dataset are classified into four categories:

    Adware
    Ransomware
    Scareware
    SMS Malware

Our samples come from 42 unique malware families. The family kinds of each category and the numbers of the captured samples are as follows:
Adware

    Dowgin family, 10 captured samples
    Ewind family, 10 captured samples
    Feiwo family, 15 captured samples
    Gooligan family, 14 captured samples
    Kemoge family, 11 captured samples
    koodous family, 10 captured samples
    Mobidash family, 10 captured samples
    Selfmite family, 4 captured samples
    Shuanet family, 10 captured samples
    Youmi family, 10 captured samples

    Pletor family, 10 captured samples
    PornDroid family, 10 captured samples
    RansomBO family, 10 captured samples

    Plankton family, 10 captured samples
    SMSsniffer family, 9 captured samples
    Zsone family, 10 captured samples

# Capturing process and content
In order to acquire a comprehensive view of our malware samples, we created a specific scenario for each malware category. We also defined three states of data capturing in order to overcome the stealthiness of advanced malware:

    Installation: The first state of data capturing which occurs immediately after installing malware (1-3 min). (In the dataset the folder name is "AfterInstall")
    Before restart: The second state of data capturing which occurs 15 min before rebooting phones. (In the dataset the folder name is "Before")
    After restart: The last state of data capturing which occurs 15 min after rebooting phones. (In the dataset the folder name is "After")
